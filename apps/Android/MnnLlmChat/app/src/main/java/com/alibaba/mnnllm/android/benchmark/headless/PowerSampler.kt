/**
 * Samples battery current during inference and reports the average in mA.
 *
 * Three-tier fallback, ported directly from a sibling project's
 * BenchmarkService.kt (readCurrentUa()/computeAvgCurrentUa() at
 * /Users/ksd/SLM_Factory-SmolChat/SmolChat-Android/app/src/main/java/io/shubham0204/smollmandroid/headless/BenchmarkService.kt)
 * to match its exact behavior rather than reconstructing it:
 *   1. [BatteryManager.BATTERY_PROPERTY_CURRENT_NOW] (microamps) via
 *      getLongProperty() - the normal path, works on most devices.
 *   2. If that returns the "unsupported" sentinel (Long.MIN_VALUE), read
 *      raw current directly from common sysfs paths ([CURRENT_SYSFS_PATHS]).
 *   3. If the WHOLE sampling window produced zero valid instantaneous
 *      readings from either of the above, fall back to a charge-counter
 *      delta: total charge drained ([BatteryManager.BATTERY_PROPERTY_CHARGE_COUNTER])
 *      over the elapsed duration, converted to an equivalent average current.
 *
 * Also exposes two independent energy figures alongside the average:
 * [getEnergyMasSampled] (mA·s, trapezoidal integration over real per-sample
 * current-only timestamps - a charge-equivalent quantity, not true energy,
 * since it implicitly assumes constant voltage) and [getEnergyMjSampled]
 * (mJ, the same trapezoidal integration but over current x voltage at each
 * sample - true energy, accounting for real per-sample voltage rather than
 * assuming it constant). A third method based on the hardware charge-counter
 * delta was considered and removed: every real benchmark run here is
 * USB-connected for ADB, and charging current contaminates a charge-delta
 * measurement with no way to separate it back out - fundamentally unreliable
 * in this project's actual setup, not just a rare edge case. (A fourth
 * option, BatteryManager.BATTERY_PROPERTY_ENERGY_COUNTER - a direct
 * fuel-gauge energy reading - was also evaluated and confirmed unsupported,
 * returning the Long.MIN_VALUE sentinel, on both real test devices used for
 * this project: a OnePlus 8 Pro and a Galaxy S23.)
